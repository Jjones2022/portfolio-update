# Features
In this particular project, the portfolio was restructured and re-styled to create a cleaner look to my profile. Links were successfully created to enhance the experience of the user with the allowance to ease of access with the click of a link. A profile picture was also added and centered in the page, so that newcomers can see who's behind the development. Bootstrap 5 was also implicated, which offers a new way to style and write code within the HTML code. It eliminates having to have a separate css document. 

# Agile Software Development
Agile Software Development allows individuals to have interactions in discussions with processes and tools to help create a project. New tools can include new processes as well as new software. This makes the developer accountable for responding to change whether it was a change to a process or change in software or collaboration when working with customers. Agile Software Development is critical in the world of developers, with things changing at a constant pace whether its demand for better processses or from the customers in order to improve and become innovative with development. These very same concepts also can apply to other areas in life and the business sector.
